I am new so please don't just judge this is my first project it's is made from scratch in opengl I did use the Dear ImGui lib for making a gui.

I also made this project while learning opengl so I ended up being done with project as soon as I finished the get started part of the learnopengl website so there is no light I could add it later if I get back to it

if you want to run this what I want you to have is -

  VS-code

  C-make
  
  C++ compiler
  
The lib are with it so I don't think you need to download anything. I don't know how to use docker yet I was planning on learning that but I have been busy lately so I plan to do it some time after.

after configuring cmake, just run the main.cpp file (not the main.cpp in framework the names are same) .

anyways this is just I side project to solidify my understanding so don't expect to much.

here are some pictures -
